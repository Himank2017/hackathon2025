The sorcerer, prideful of his magic, mocked the farmer's simple life. In response, the farmer offered the sorcerer his finest meal without resentment. Moved by this kindness, the sorcerer realized that true power lies not in spells and enchantments, but in the ability to show compassion even to those who show none in return.' The owl fixes its penetrating gaze upon you. 'Remember, traveler, kindness costs nothing but enriches both the giver and receiver.'
