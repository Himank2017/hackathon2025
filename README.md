# 📚 My Interactive Story Adventure App

Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student, and I created this app to make learning more fun! Here's how it works:

## 🎯 What Does The App Do?

This app lets you read and interact with educational stories. Instead of just reading straight through, you get to make choices that change how the story goes! It's like being the main character in your own adventure while learning about:

- 🔢 Math (Fractions, Integers, Numbers)
- 📝 English
- 🧪 Science
- 🌍 Social Studies

## 🗺️ How Stories Work

Each story is like a tree with many branches. Here's a simple flow diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Story Start] -->|Choice 1| B[Path A]
    A -->|Choice 2| C[Path B]
    B --> D[Next Scene]
    C --> E[Different Scene]
    D -->|Continue| F[Ending 1]
    E -->|Continue| G[Ending 2]
```

### 📖 Example Story Flow

Here's how "The Fraction Friends' Big Feast" works:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start at Pie Shop] -->|Help share pie| B[Share First Pie]
    A -->|Learn about fractions| C[Learn Basics]
    B --> D[Cut into Thirds]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Equivalent Fractions]
    E --> F[Adding Fractions]
    F --> G[Compare Fractions]
    G --> H[Happy Ending]
```

## 🎮 How to Use the App

1. **Pick a Subject**: Choose from different subjects like Math, English, Science
2. **Choose a Story**: Each subject has different stories
3. **Make Choices**: Read the story and click on choices
4. **Learn & Have Fun**: Each path teaches you something new!
